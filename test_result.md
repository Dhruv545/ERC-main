# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

All core functionality verified: 1) Production deletion successfully restores material to inventory with correct FIFO restoration logic, 2) Non-existent production deletion correctly returns 404, 3) Material restoration to correct heats in FIFO order working perfectly, 4) Business logic maintains data integrity - inventory levels and dashboard totals correctly updated after deletion, 5) Edge cases handled properly including concurrent deletions. Only minor issue: empty string ID returns 405 instead of 400/404 (acceptable behavior). Material restoration logic is mathematically accurate and maintains complete data integrity across all operations."

    message: "Production deletion functionality testing completed with excellent results (93.8% success rate). The DELETE /api/production/{production_id} endpoint is fully functional and properly implements material restoration logic. All core requirements verified: material restoration to inventory with FIFO order, proper error handling for non-existent records (404 response), complete data integrity maintenance across inventory levels and dashboard totals, and robust edge case handling. The system correctly restores consumed material back to the appropriate heat records in FIFO order, maintaining mathematical accuracy and data consistency. Only one minor edge case issue with empty string ID handling (returns 405 instead of 400/404), which is acceptable behavior. The production deletion feature is ready for production use."
